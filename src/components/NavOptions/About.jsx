                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p style={{paddingBottom: "20px"}}>To transform the stressful process of urban parking into a seamless, predictable, and transparent experience, giving drivers back their time and reducing city congestion.</p>
                
                    <h2>The Parkway Story</h2>
                    <p style={{paddingBottom: "20px"}}>We started Parkway because we were tired of the "parking panic"—the frustration of circling crowded blocks, the surprise fees, and the unnecessary fuel waste. We realized that with modern technology, finding parking shouldn't be a gamble; it should be an expectation. Parkway was founded on the belief that better data leads to better decisions, and we built a solution that puts real-time parking information right in the palm of your hand.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
                    <ul style={{paddingBottom: "20px", paddingLeft: "20px"}}>
                        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Maximizing time saved for every driver.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> No hidden fees, ever. Clear pricing and availability guaranteed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Providing accurate, real-time data you can trust.</li>
                        <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Constantly refining our technology to adapt to new urban environments (campuses, business districts, etc.).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What Makes Parkway Unique?</h2>
                    <p style={{paddingBottom: "20px"}}>While other apps show parking locations, Parkway shows real-time slot availability and allows for direct reservation. We are the only solution that guarantees you know the price and secure your spot before you leave for your destination.
